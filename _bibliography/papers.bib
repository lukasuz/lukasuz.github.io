  abstract={
    Virtual reality headsets, such as the HTC Vive, enable the user to move around in the virtual world through real movements. However, this is only applicable to a limited extent, as the walkable real space is usually significantly smaller than the virtual space. Scaling techniques make it possible to travel long distances in the virtual world by manipulating the virtual size of the user. In this paper, we present an experiment in which we compare two scaling techniques versus accelerated walking on the basis of usability, sense of presence, motion sickness and spatial understanding. Our results show that automatic scaling in its current form performs significantly worse in terms of usability and motion sickness than accelerated walking and self-determined scaling. Self-determined scaling, however, is an equivalent alternative to accelerated walking.
