Advances in deep-learning-based pipelines have led to breakthroughs in a variety of microscopy image diagnostics. However, a sufficiently big training data set is usually difficult to obtain due to high annotation costs. In the case of banded chromosome images, the creation of big enough libraries is difficult for multiple pathologies due to the rarity of certain genetic disorders. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be effective in generating synthetic images and extending training data sets. In our work, we implement a conditional GAN (cGAN) that allows generation of realistic single chromosome images following user-defined banding patterns. To this end, an image-to-image translation approach based on automatically created 2D chromosome segmentation label maps is used. Our validation shows promising results when synthesizing chromosomes with seen as well as unseen banding patterns. We believe that this approach can be exploited for data augmentation of chromosome data sets with structural abnormalities. Therefore, the proposed method could help to tackle medical image analysis problems such as data simulation, segmentation, detection, or classification in the field of cytogenetics.  },

    Virtual reality headsets, such as the HTC Vive, enable the user to move around in the virtual world through real movements. However, this is only applicable to a limited extent, as the walkable real space is usually significantly smaller than the virtual space. Scaling techniques make it possible to travel long distances in the virtual world by manipulating the virtual size of the user. In this paper, we present an experiment in which we compare two scaling techniques versus accelerated walking on the basis of usability, sense of presence, motion sickness and spatial understanding. Our results show that automatic scaling in its current form performs significantly worse in terms of usability and motion sickness than accelerated walking and self-determined scaling. Self-determined scaling, however, is an equivalent alternative to accelerated walking.
