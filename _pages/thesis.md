We are looking for motivated master students at TU Delft to write their thesis with. We are generally interested in topics involving Neural Rendering and Image Synthesis such as: 
<ul>
    <li>3D Representation Learning (e.g. <a href="https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf">Neural Radiance Fields  (NeRF)</a>)</li>
    <li>Dynamic 3D Representation Learning (e.g. <a href="https://lukas.uzolas.com/Articulated-Point-NeRF/">our work</a>)</li>
    <li>Generative Models (e.g. <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/eg3d/">Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)</a>, <a href="https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/">Diffusion Models</a>)</li>
</ul>
If you feel like our interests align, feel free to message me or <a href="http://kellnhofer.xyz/">Petr</a> directly.
