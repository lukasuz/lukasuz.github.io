If you are a motivated master's student at TU Delft and would like to write your thesis with us, we are generally interested in topics involving 3D motion at the intersection of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. For example: 
<ul>
    <li>Controllable reconstruction of dynamic 3D Representations (<a href="https://lukas.uzolas.com/Articulated-Point-NeRF/">example</a>)</li>
    <li>Zero-shot animation of 3D Meshes (<a href="https://lukas.uzolas.com/MotionDreamer/">example</a>)</li>
    <li>Using pre-trained foundational models for down-stream tasks (<a href="https://lukas.uzolas.com/SurfaceAware3DFeaturesSite/">example</a>)</li>
    
</ul>
If you feel like our interests align, feel free to <a href="mailto:lukas@uzolas.com">message me</a> or <a href="http://kellnhofer.xyz/">Petr</a> directly.
