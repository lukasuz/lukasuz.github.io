Hey! I recently finished my Master's degree in <a href="http://ipcv.eu/">Computer Vision and Image Processing</a> under the Erasmus Mundus initiative, taking place at three different universities and countries. I wrote my thesis at the Visual Computing Group at Harvard University <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/">(VCG)</a>, supervised by <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/people/hanspeter-pfister">Hanspeter Pfister</a>, <a href="https://donglaiw.github.io/">Donglai Wei</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pierrickcoupe/">Pierrick Coupé</a>. Before that, I did my Bachelor's at the University of Hamburg in <a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/hci.html">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, while working as a software developer at various companies. For more detailed information and projects, check my CV.

My research interests lie in vision systems involving human factors. More specifically, I am interested in generative models that can be used for synthesising novel <i>things</i> and image manipulation, for imagery revolving around humans.

<!-- Having a background in Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction, I am passionate
about vision systems involving human factors. Especially use-cases that have a practical
application interest me, due to my experience as a developer. I recently finished my Master’s
thesis in cooperation with VCG at SEAS Harvard, and thus I am looking for new challenges.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
