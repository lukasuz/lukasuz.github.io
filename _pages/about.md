Hey, I am a PhD Candidate at <a href="https://graphics.tudelft.nl/">CGV</a>, TU Delft (Netherlands). My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. Generally, I am interested in Machine Learning, Neural Rendering, and Generative Models. I am currently focusing on learning motion from 2D data, allowing for the synthesis of controllable and 3D consistent images and videos.

I received an M.Sc. degree with distinction in <a href="http://ipcv.eu/">Computer Vision and Image Processing</a>, jointly coordinated by the Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain), University of Bordeaux (France), and Pázmány Péter Catholic University (Hungary) under the Erasmus Mundus initiative. I wrote my Master's thesis at the <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/">Visual Computing Group</a> at Harvard University (USA). Before this, I obtained a B.Sc. with honours at the University of Hamburg (Germany) in <a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/hci.html">Human-Computer Interaction</a>. Next to my studies, I was working as a software developer at various companies.

<!-- Having a background in Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction, I am passionate
about vision systems involving human factors. Especially use-cases that have a practical
application interest me, due to my experience as a developer. I recently finished my Master’s
thesis in cooperation with VCG at SEAS Harvard, and thus I am looking for new challenges.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
